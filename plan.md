# plan.md — working plan

This is the **living** plan. It tracks current state, deviations from
`initial_plan.md`, open questions, and decisions. Update it as work progresses.
The original 4-stage roadmap (Stages 0–4 + contributions + timeline) lives in
`initial_plan.md` and should not be edited.

---

## Current state — 2026-04-08 (Day 1)

**Stage**: 1, 2, and 3 first-cut complete on the full 277-episode
`basic_pick_place` test split. Stage 3 has a quality assessment
(R-008): retargeting captures grasp affordance class but not
within-class precision — sufficient for Stage 4 BC, not a finished
teleop product.
**Last action**: Wrote `src/mimicdreamer_egodex/finger_retargeting.py`
(Stage 3 deliverable) + `notebooks/04_stage3_batch.py` and ran the batch:
277/277 episodes, 0 failures, **90.7 s total wall time** (~2.4 ms/frame
mean — fast because the `SeqRetargeting` instance is per-side cached and
warm-starts after frame 0 of each episode). Target hand = **Inspire**;
`dex-retargeting` ships `offline/inspire_hand_{left,right}.yml` so no
custom YAML is needed, and the URDFs are vendored at
`third_party/dex-urdf@7304c7f`. Results: **96.8%** of episodes have 6/6
target proximals clearing the Inspire variance guard (> 0.1 rad range),
thumb yaw has the widest per-episode variance (p05 0.19 → p95 0.77 rad,
task-adaptive opposition), median `ms/frame = 2.4`. Stage 3 tail (9
episodes with <6/6) splits cleanly into 3 episodes overlapping Stage 1
R-006 (low wrist/fingertip confidence → shared data issue) + 6 short
episodes (<80 frames, data-constrained variance floor); no overlap with
Stage 2's IK tail. Torch nightly cu128 is now installed out-of-band (RTX
5090 sm_120 verified) so Stage 4's environment is ~half-prepared.
Run log: `logs/runs/2026-04-08_104408_stage3_batch.log`.
**Next action**: (a) Stage 4 — install lerobot out-of-band per D-001,
convert stabilized frames + `[q_arm_6, gripper_1, q_finger_6]` action
vectors into the lerobot dataset format, train ACT on `basic_pick_place`,
build the ablation table from §4.4. (b) Optional MuJoCo visualization of
Stage 3 outputs via a `notebooks/05_stage3_visualize.py` if/when the user
wants to eyeball a rollout. (c) Neither the Stage 1 R-006 fallback nor
the Stage 2 IK tail has been re-investigated — still parked.

### Environment status
- [x] uv project initialized, Python 3.13. (Reinstalled uv on 2026-04-08:
      RunPod container restart wiped `/root/.local/`, but `/workspace/.venv`
      and `uv.lock` survived; `curl install.sh | sh` + `uv python install 3.13`
      restored everything in <30 s.)
- [x] Base deps installed (`uv sync`): h5py, numpy, opencv-python, scipy, jupyter, etc.
- [x] Stage 1 deps installed (`uv sync --group stage1`): vidstab 1.7.4.
- [x] Stage 2 deps installed (`uv sync --group stage2` + `uv add --group stage2
      robot_descriptions`): mink 1.1.0, mujoco 3.6.0, quadprog 0.1.13,
      qpsolvers 4.11.0, daqp 0.8.5, robot_descriptions 1.23.0.
- [x] Stage 3 deps installed (`uv sync --group stage1 --group stage2 --group
      stage3`): dex-retargeting 0.4.5, pin 3.9.0, libpinocchio 3.9.0,
      eigenpy 3.12.0, nlopt 2.10.0, pytransform3d 3.14.4, lxml 6.0.2,
      libcoal 3.0.2. URDFs vendored at `third_party/dex-urdf@7304c7f`.
- [x] Torch nightly cu128 installed out-of-band (D-001 recipe): torch
      2.12.0.dev20260407+cu128, torchvision 0.27.0.dev20260407+cu128,
      triton 3.7.0+git9c288bc5. RTX 5090 sm_120 capability (12, 0)
      verified. Unblocks `dex_retargeting` (which hard-imports torch) and
      prepares Stage 4.
- [ ] Stage 4: lerobot — installed manually when Stage 4 starts.
- [x] EgoDex **test split only** downloaded (`data/test.zip`, 16.1 GB) and
      extracted to `data/test/` — 111 task subdirs, 6,598 file entries.
      See **D-005** below: we are not downloading any other EgoDex split.

### Hardware confirmed
- RunPod, RTX 5090 (Blackwell, sm_120). Stable PyTorch cannot target this; must use
  cu128 nightly.

## Decisions and deviations from `initial_plan.md`

### D-001: torch / lerobot are installed out-of-band, not via pyproject
**Why**: torch nightly cu128 requires `triton==3.7.0+git9c288bc5` (a local-version
wheel hosted on the pytorch nightly index). uv's resolver does not surface that wheel
through source mapping, even with `prerelease = "allow"`. Lerobot additionally caps
torch at `<2.11`, conflicting with the nightlies.

**How to apply**: After `uv sync`, run

```bash
uv pip install --pre --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128 \
    torch torchvision
```

For lerobot, when Stage 4 starts: try `uv pip install --no-deps lerobot` and pull in
its remaining deps manually, OR fork lerobot and bump the torch ceiling. Decide
which path at the time based on which is less invasive.

### D-003: Every step is logged to `/workspace/logs/`
**Why**: The user is often away and reviews logs after the fact to catch errors and
understand what happened. Without disciplined logging, surprises (failed downloads,
silent IK divergence, off-by-one episode indexing) get lost in scrollback.

**How to apply**: See the **Logging** section in `CLAUDE.md` for the full rules.
Two log types:
- `logs/session_YYYY-MM-DD.md` — append-only per-day narrative; lab-notebook style.
- `logs/runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_<slug>.log` — captured stdout/stderr from any
  non-trivial command, linked from the session entry.
Errors get full tracebacks; decisions get mirrored back into this file.

### D-005: EgoDex test split is the *only* data we use
**Why**: User decision, 2026-04-07. The test split (16.1 GB, 111 tasks,
~6,600 files, ~277 `basic_pick_place` episodes worth ~17.9 minutes of
footage at 30 Hz) is enough for the partial replication and the variance
report has already validated it. Avoiding the multi-hundred-GB Part 1/2
downloads keeps disk usage and iteration time small.

**How to apply**:
- Stage 1 (`egostabilizer.py`) — develop and benchmark on `data/test/<task>/`.
- Stage 2 (`action_alignment.py`) — same. Use the active hand of each
  episode (from `notebooks/01_variance_report.py` logic).
- Stage 3 (`finger_retargeting.py`) — same.
- Stage 4 (policy training) — train and evaluate on the `basic_pick_place`
  split *of the test set* (277 episodes). The original §4.2 plan mentioned
  Part 2 explicitly; that is overridden. The dataset is small for a behavior
  cloning policy, so expect the §4.4 ablation table to be more about
  pipeline-quality deltas than absolute success rates.
- `initial_plan.md` §0.3 / §4.2 references to `part2.zip` and Part 2 data
  are now obsolete — treat them as historical context, not active plan.

### D-004: EgoDex HDF5 schema differs from `initial_plan.md` §0.3
**Why**: The schema documented in `initial_plan.md` (a `/hand/{left,right}/joints`
group with packed `(T,25,3)` arrays plus a `/language/annotation` string and a
`/camera/extrinsic` array) does not match the real `test.zip`. Actual layout
(verified on `data/test/basic_pick_place/0.hdf5`):

- `/camera/intrinsic` — `(3,3)` ✓ matches
- `/transforms/camera` — `(T,4,4)` per-frame camera-to-world (NOT under
  `/camera/extrinsic`)
- `/transforms/leftHand`, `/transforms/rightHand` — wrist `(T,4,4)` SE(3)
- `/transforms/<jointName>` — every other joint is its own `(T,4,4)`. There
  are 69 such datasets per file: camera, hip, spine1..7, neck1..4, both
  shoulders/arms/forearms, and 25 joints per hand (1 wrist + 4 thumb +
  4 fingers × 5 each). 25-joint hand layout is preserved, just unpacked.
- `/confidences/<jointName>` — `(T,)` per-joint ARKit confidence (one per
  transform; spine/neck/etc. included)
- Language metadata lives in **file-level HDF5 attributes**, not a dataset:
  `task`, `description`, `llm_description`, `llm_objects`, `llm_verbs`,
  `environment` (e.g. `'hand:right'`), `session_name`, etc.

**How to apply**: Treat `initial_plan.md` §0.3 code snippets as pseudocode for
the *intent* (load wrist trajectory + finger joints + confidence + intrinsics)
but use `transforms/<joint>` paths in real code. The 25-joint-per-hand list is
hard-coded in `notebooks/00_explore_egodex.py::hand_joint_names`. When Stage 2
needs finger spreads, stack the per-joint datasets explicitly. The Stage 0.3
exploration script and Stage 0 variance report both follow this corrected
schema.

Sub-finding: ARKit confidence values appear to be in roughly the 0.3–0.7 range,
not the [0,1]-with-most-frames-near-1 distribution implied by §0.3. On
`basic_pick_place/0.hdf5` no frame had a per-hand mean confidence above 0.8.
This means a confidence threshold of 0.5 (per `initial_plan.md` §2.1) will
reject most data unless the threshold is recalibrated. Open question for
Stage 2 — investigate whether 0.5 is right for this dataset, or whether
confidence is meant to be interpreted relatively per joint.

### D-002: Stage groups are gated behind explicit `uv sync --group <stage>`
**Why**: Each stage adds heavy deps (mink pulls quadprog + a QP solver chain;
dex-retargeting pulls SAPIEN). Keeping them off the default sync makes onboarding
fast on a fresh box and avoids resolution churn during Stages 0–1.

**How to apply**: When you start a new stage, run the matching `uv sync --group stageN`
*before* writing code for it. Update the README setup section if a new group is added.

## Resolved questions

### R-001: Stage 1 — table-distance assumption  *(answered 2026-04-07)*
**Original question**: Is the §1.1 hard-coded `table_dist = 0.5 m` acceptable, or
do we need per-episode estimation?

**Answer**: Both the constant *and* the up-axis assumption in `initial_plan.md`
§1.1 are wrong.
- ARKit / EgoDex world frame is **y-up**, not z-up. Verified empirically:
  on `basic_pick_place/0.hdf5` the camera y is essentially constant at
  ~1.07 m while wrist y varies between 0.80–0.98 m. The §1.1 snippet's
  `n = [0, 0, 1]` would point along the depth axis, not the table normal.
- The actual camera-to-(estimated)-table distance across 277
  `basic_pick_place` episodes: median 0.243 m, p10/p90 = 0.171 / 0.312 m,
  global frame range 0.105 – 0.727 m. Only 0.4% of episodes have a per-episode
  mean within ±20% of 0.5 m. So 0.5 m is wrong by roughly 2×.
- The "estimated table plane" here is `5th-percentile-wrist-y` over the
  active hand (the lowest the hand goes, on the assumption that the wrist
  briefly touches the table during pick/place). The real surface is 5–10 cm
  below that because the wrist sits above the contact point. Even after
  that correction, true camera-to-table is ~0.30–0.35 m, still well below
  0.5 m.

**How to apply (Stage 1)**:
1. Use **y-up** in EgoStabilizer. The table plane normal in world frame is
   `n_world = (0, 1, 0)`. To get the normal in the camera-1 frame for the
   homography formula, transform by the inverse of the camera-1 rotation:
   `n_cam = R_w2c @ n_world` where `R_w2c = (cam[:3, :3]).T` if
   `transforms/camera` is camera-to-world (verify on first run).
2. Do **not** use a hard-coded distance constant. We have per-frame camera
   poses, so compute the distance exactly per frame:
   - Estimate `table_y` once per episode as `5th percentile of active-hand
     wrist world-y` (cheap, robust). Optionally subtract a small bias
     (~5 cm) to account for the wrist-above-fingertips offset, but for
     stabilization the bias mostly washes out.
   - At frame `t`, `d_t = |cam_y_world[t] - table_y|`.
3. The §1.1 RANSAC fallback (vidstab) is still useful for episodes whose
   wrist tracking is too noisy to estimate `table_y` confidently — gate the
   exact-homography path on having ≥ 5 frames where the active hand's mean
   confidence is above the threshold from R-002.

### R-003: Stage 1 — confirmed `transforms/camera` is camera-to-world  *(answered 2026-04-08)*
**Original question** (action item from `doc.md` §3.1): the convention was
inferred from the magnitude of the translation column on `basic_pick_place/0`
but never empirically pinned down. Stage 1 depends on it for sign correctness.

**Answer**: camera-to-world. Verified on `basic_pick_place/0.hdf5`:
- `transforms/camera[t][:3, 3]` mean = `(-0.077, 1.069, -0.395)`, std
  `(0.022, 0.015, 0.010)` over 126 frames. The y-component sits at head
  height for a seated AVP wearer (~1.07 m) and is ~constant. If this were
  world-to-camera the translation would be the world origin in the camera's
  coordinate system, which would not generically land at head height.
- The cam y-mean (1.069) is above the right-wrist y-mean (0.877), matching
  "head above hand".
- `R R^T - I` is at machine precision; `det(R) = +1`. So the rotation block
  is a proper rotation, not a left-handed flip.

Verification log: `logs/runs/2026-04-08_*_verify_camera_convention.log`.

**How to apply**: in code, treat `transforms/camera[t]` as `T_world_cam_t`
(`X_world = T @ X_cam`). To go to camera frame, invert by transposing the
rotation and applying `-R^T t` — see `egostabilizer.plane_homography`.

### R-004: Stage 1 — sign of the plane-induced homography  *(answered 2026-04-08)*
**Original question**: while smoke-testing `egostabilizer.py` on
`basic_pick_place/1`, stabilization barely reduced inter-frame ORB
displacement (1.04× ratio) and the inlier H-RMSE was ~125 px. The geometry
matched the textbook formula `H = K (R - t n^T / d) K^-1`, but something was
clearly wrong.

**Answer**: the textbook minus-sign assumes a different (src, dst) ordering.
Re-deriving from scratch with our convention (`X_dst = R_ds X_src + t_ds` and
`n_s^T X_s = d_s` describing the plane in the source frame) gives:

    X_d = R_ds X_s + t_ds * (n_s.T X_s / d_s) = (R_ds + t_ds n_s.T / d_s) X_s

i.e. **plus**, not minus. The minus form in Hartley & Zisserman corresponds to
the opposite ordering / inward-pointing normal convention. With the plus sign,
on `basic_pick_place/1`:

| metric                       | before fix | after fix |
|-----------------------------|-----------:|----------:|
| stab inter-frame disp (px)  |       6.65 |      2.11 |
| reduction ratio             |       1.35 |      4.25 |
| inlier H-RMSE (px, median)  |     125.6  |       5.5 |

And on `basic_pick_place/0` (mostly static): 6.05 → 0.92 px (6.6× ratio),
inlier H-RMSE 1.5 px.

**How to apply**: the corrected formula lives at
`egostabilizer.plane_homography`. The `+` sign is non-negotiable for our
(src→dst, world-y-up, camera-to-world `transforms/camera`) convention.
Re-derive from scratch (do not copy from a textbook) if any of those
assumptions ever change.

A second metric subtlety surfaced at the same time: the *raw* H-RMSE
(measured against all ORB matches between frame 0 and a far frame t) is
dominated by features on the moving hand and the manipulated object, which
no plane-induced homography can predict. The metric is only meaningful after
inlier filtering — keep the best 50% of per-pair reprojection errors. The
implementation in `homography_reprojection_rmse` does this.

### D-007: Stage 3 — `SeqRetargeting.retarget(ref_value)` expects a pre-sliced `(5, 3)` input  *(decided 2026-04-08)*
**Why**: The YAML `target_link_human_indices: [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]` in
`dex-retargeting/configs/offline/inspire_hand_*.yml` is a MediaPipe-21-point
landmark layout — those are the fingertip indices in the 21-point hand
model. The code however does **not** index into the 21-point array
internally: `SeqRetargeting.retarget` passes `ref_value` straight through
to `PositionOptimizer.get_objective_function`, which feeds it directly
into `torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss` against a `(5, 3)` body-position tensor.
Passing a `(21, 3)` array triggers a silent PyTorch broadcasting warning
and produces garbage. Caller must pre-slice to `(5, 3)` in the order
matching the config's `target_link_names`:

    [thumb_tip, index_tip, middle_tip, ring_tip, pinky_tip]

**How to apply**: `finger_retargeting.py::wrist_relative_tips` returns a
`(T, 5, 3)` array in exactly this order; Stage 3's extraction puts
`<side>ThumbTip`, `<side>IndexFingerTip`, `<side>MiddleFingerTip`,
`<side>RingFingerTip`, `<side>LittleFingerTip` (= pinky) in that order.
Do not pass a length-21 array. Flagged inline in the module docstring
and verified empirically on `basic_pick_place/0` — the `(5, 3)` path
produces per-joint ranges of 0.41–0.68 rad; the `(21, 3)` path silently
converges to near-zero deltas. (The latter is how the earlier dry-run
with fake inputs ended up with 0.0001 rad "curl deltas".)

### D-008: `uv sync --group <stage>` replaces the active group set  *(decided 2026-04-08)*
**Why**: The first `uv sync --group stage3` I ran silently **uninstalled**
the Stage 2 packages (mink, mujoco, quadprog, robot_descriptions, etc.)
because uv treats the `--group` flag as a replacement selection, not
additive. This broke `action_alignment.py`'s import chain and would have
broken any re-run of the Stage 2 batch.

**How to apply**: when syncing, always pass **every active group
simultaneously**:

```bash
uv sync --group stage1 --group stage2 --group stage3
```

This rule is also mirrored into `CLAUDE.md` under the tooling section
so future sessions don't trip over it. `uv add --group <stage> <pkg>`
does not have the same footgun — it only edits the one group. The trap
is `uv sync` specifically.

### R-007: Stage 3 — Inspire hand locked in; `dex-retargeting` ships the config  *(answered 2026-04-08)*
**Original question**: Does `dex-retargeting` ship an Inspire-hand config
in `assets/`? If not, write a YAML for the Allegro hand instead.

**Answer**: **Yes, Inspire is supported out of the box.** The
`dex_retargeting` wheel bundles both
`configs/offline/inspire_hand_left.yml` and
`configs/offline/inspire_hand_right.yml` (also teleop variants which we
don't use). The referenced URDFs (`inspire_hand/inspire_hand_{side}.urdf`)
live in the separate `dex-urdf` repo (the `dex-retargeting` pip wheel
does NOT carry URDFs). We vendor it at
`third_party/dex-urdf@7304c7fb59214dab870eca02cf26f76e944e12df`
(gitignored) and point `RetargetingConfig.set_default_urdf_dir` at
`third_party/dex-urdf/robots/hands` in `finger_retargeting.py::_ensure_urdf_dir`.
Override via `$DEX_URDF_DIR` if the repo is cloned elsewhere.

Inspire details:
- Type: `position` retargeting (5-fingertip positions, SmoothL1 loss).
- 12 non-dummy URDF DOFs, of which **6 are "target" (optimized)**:
  `{index, middle, ring, pinky}_proximal_joint`, `thumb_proximal_yaw_joint`,
  `thumb_proximal_pitch_joint`. The intermediate and distal joints are
  declared as mimic joints in the URDF and track their proximals
  automatically.
- `add_dummy_free_joint: True` prepends a 6-DOF free joint at the hand
  root so the optimizer can absorb any input-frame offset — which is why
  we can feed wrist-relative positions in world axes without rotating to
  a hand-local frame.
- Input contract is the `(5, 3)` slice described in D-007.

**How to apply (Stage 3/4)**:
- Stage 3: `finger_retargeting.py` writes `q_finger (T, 6)` per episode,
  in the action-vector order
  `[index, middle, ring, pinky, thumb_yaw, thumb_pitch]`.
- Stage 4: final action vector per `initial_plan.md` §3.3 is
  `[q_arm_6, gripper_1, q_finger_6]` = **13 dimensions**. Concatenate
  Stage 2's `outputs/stage2/<idx>_actions.npz` with Stage 3's
  `outputs/stage3/<idx>_fingers.npz` at dataset-build time.

The hand choice can still be revisited later (Allegro has 16 DOFs, LEAP
has 16, Shadow has ~22) — all four configs are in the same
`dex-retargeting/configs/offline/` directory and would require only
swapping one constant in `finger_retargeting.py`. Sticking with Inspire
for the replication because 6 DOFs keeps the Stage 4 action head small
and matches the paper's closest comparable setup.

### R-008: Stage 3 — retargeting quality is affordance-class adequate, not within-class precision  *(answered 2026-04-08)*
**Original question**: Is the Stage 3 finger retargeting actually
"good"? The 96.8% variance-guard pass rate (R-007) tells us nothing
*moves wrong*, but says nothing about whether the retargeted joint
angles encode object identity in a useful way.

**Answer**: The retargeting is **successful for the project's goal**
(BC training in Stage 4) but is **not** a precision-grade dexterous
teleoperation system. Concretely:

- **Per-finger position error** between human EgoDex fingertips and
  Inspire FK fingertips (`notebooks/05_stage3_visualize.py` on a
  4-episode sample): **median 5–10 mm, p95 10–20 mm**. Inspire's
  fingerpad is ~15 mm wide, so a 10 mm error is ~60% of the pad. Fine
  for power grasps (the dataset is 100% power grasps), marginal for
  precision pinches.

- **Per-object grasp clustering** (`notebooks/07_grasp_clustering.py`)
  on 174 episodes covering 25 distinct objects (each with ≥ 3 episodes):
  - 6-D peak-grasp signature: separation ratio 0.81, silhouette −0.27
  - **18-D trajectory signature: separation ratio 0.95, silhouette −0.15**
  - Both raw numbers are < 1 / negative — but the *most-distinct pairs*
    are physically meaningful: `dice box vs toy block = 1.34 rad`,
    `iphone vs toy block = 1.31 rad`, `iphone vs fry = 1.26 rad`. The
    *most-similar pairs* are also physically similar:
    `iphone vs mouse = 0.15`, `container of slime vs donut = 0.16`,
    `plushie vs tea cup = 0.17`. Pairwise distances among the 6 largest
    object groups show clean affordance-class structure: small-hard
    objects (`block`, `dice`, `egg`) cluster together; soft plush
    objects (`duck`, `plushie`) cluster together; cross-group distances
    are larger.

- **Verdict**: the retargeting captures **grasp affordance class**
  (small hard, soft plush, flat thin, …) but **does not** discriminate
  fine-grained within-class differences. This is consistent with three
  hard limits: (a) the 6-DOF Inspire embodiment can only express a
  limited grasp vocabulary, (b) the `llm_objects` labels are noisy
  ("block" lumps 41 physically diverse cubes together), (c) we are
  matching fingertip *positions*, not contact normals or forces.

**What this means for Stage 4**: this is **enough**. The action signal
needs to encode *how to grasp* (affordance level); object identity
comes from the RGB observation. The BC policy will absorb residual
retargeting noise. The bar this needs to clear is set by the §4.4
ablation table — outperform the binary-gripper baseline. That
experiment hasn't run yet; the verdict on "is the dexterous hand
actually pulling its weight" is **TBD until Stage 4**.

**What this is NOT**: not physics-validated (no contact-closure check
on retargeted poses), not closed-loop (no force feedback, same as the
MimicDreamer baseline), not jointly optimized with Stage 2 (the wrist
mount can drift between the two stages), not validated on anything
other than `basic_pick_place`.

**How to apply**:
- Trust the action signal at the **affordance class** level.
- Do **not** trust it for fine within-class object discrimination —
  rely on the RGB input for that.
- Re-evaluate after Stage 4 ablation results land.
- Full discussion is in `doc.md` §8.7.8.

### D-009: RunPod needs `apt install libegl1` for MuJoCo headless rendering  *(decided 2026-04-08)*
**Why**: The RunPod base image ships
`libEGL_nvidia.so.570.195.03` (the NVIDIA driver's EGL implementation)
but **not** the generic `libEGL.so.1` dispatcher that PyOpenGL looks
for. `import mujoco` followed by `Renderer(...)` fails with
`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'eglQueryString'`
because PyOpenGL can't find the entry point.

**How to apply**: one-liner per fresh container:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libegl1 libglvnd0
```

Then `os.environ["MUJOCO_GL"] = "egl"` **before** `import mujoco` in
any script that uses offscreen rendering. The
`mujoco.Renderer(model, h, w)` smoke test should pass with non-zero
nonzero pixel count.

`libegl1-mesa` was renamed/removed in Ubuntu 24.04 — don't install
that one, just `libegl1` + `libglvnd0`.

### D-010: MuJoCo URDF loader needs `strippath="false" discardvisual="true"` injection  *(decided 2026-04-08)*
**Why**: MuJoCo's URDF loader has two opinionated defaults:

1. `strippath="true"` — flattens `filename="meshes/visual/foo.glb"`
   to `foo.glb`, breaking subdirectory layouts like dex-urdf's
   `meshes/{visual,collision}/`.
2. It loads visual meshes by default, and dex-urdf's visual meshes
   are `.glb` (not supported by MuJoCo — only `.obj` and `.stl`
   work). The collision meshes are `.obj` and load fine.

**How to apply**: inject a `<mujoco>` extension block immediately
after `<robot ...>` when reading the URDF, before passing it to
`mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path`:

```python
mesh_dir = str(urdf_path.parent.absolute()) + "/"
injection = (
    f'<mujoco>'
    f'<compiler meshdir="{mesh_dir}" strippath="false" '
    f'discardvisual="true"/>'
    f'</mujoco>'
)
txt = re.sub(r"(<robot[^>]*>)", r"\1" + injection, urdf_text, count=1)
```

The hand will render with collision-mesh primitives (blocky/industrial
look — fully legible, just not pretty). See
`notebooks/06_stage3_animate.py::_inspire_mjcf_prepare`.

### D-011: MuJoCo URDF `<mujoco>` extension silently ignores `<visual>` children  *(decided 2026-04-08)*
**Why**: I tried injecting a `<visual><global offwidth="720" offheight="480"/></visual>`
sub-element into the same `<mujoco>` block to enlarge the offscreen
framebuffer beyond the 640×480 default. MuJoCo's URDF parser silently
**discarded** it — only `<compiler>` was honored. Asking for a
720-wide render still raised
`Image width 720 > framebuffer width 640`.

**How to apply**: when rendering Inspire (or any URDF) via MuJoCo
offscreen, **use the default 640×480 framebuffer** (matplotlib
animations can stay at 720×480 — only the MuJoCo render is constrained).
Define separate constants `MJ_FRAME_W = 640, MJ_FRAME_H = 480` and
build `mujoco.Renderer(model, MJ_FRAME_H, MJ_FRAME_W)`. Larger
framebuffers would require writing a standalone MJCF wrapper — but
MJCF can't `<include>` URDFs, so that path is closed for vendored
URDF assets.

### R-006: Stage 1 — 6 episodes actually fall through to the RANSAC fallback  *(answered 2026-04-08)*
**Original claim (R-004 / doc.md §8.5.4)**: the `CONF_TRACKED = 0.10`
confidence floor is loose enough that "no episode in the test split is
expected to fail it for the wrist joint" — so the vidstab fallback can
stay a stub.

**Answer**: that claim was wrong. The full-task Stage 1 batch over 277
`basic_pick_place` episodes classified 6 of them as `ransac_fallback`
(i.e. fewer than 5 active-hand wrist frames above `CONF_TRACKED`):

| idx | frames | active hand | stab reduction |
|----:|------:|-------------|---------------:|
|  15 |    51 | right       |         1.00 × |
|  26 |   127 | left        |         1.00 × |
| 102 |   100 | left        |         1.00 × |
| 131 |   142 | left        |         1.00 × |
| 192 |   125 | left        |         1.00 × |
| 251 |   113 | left        |         1.00 × |

5 of 6 are left-hand — the ARKit left-hand wrist-confidence distribution on
this task has a longer low tail than the right. The `1.00×` reduction is
expected: the fallback path is currently a stub that writes raw frames
unchanged, so raw disp == stab disp by construction.

Importantly, **these 6 episodes do not overlap with the Stage 2 IK tail**
(see `doc.md` §8.6.8) — Stage 2's tail is an IK convergence issue, not a
data quality issue.

**How to apply**:
1. Update `doc.md` §8.5.4 to state "6 episodes do fall through; the
   fallback is currently a stub" instead of "none expected".
2. Wire in a real vidstab RANSAC path when either: (a) Stage 4 ablation
   metrics regress on these 6 episodes vs. the 271 `exact` ones, or (b)
   the Stage 2 batch ends up needing them. Neither condition holds yet.
3. For now, these 6 episodes still produce stabilized MP4s (just
   unchanged) and produce valid Stage 2 joint trajectories, so they do
   not block anything.

### R-005: Stage 2 — arm URDF  *(answered 2026-04-08)*
**Original question**: Which arm URDF to target for IK? `initial_plan.md` §2.3
is agnostic; FIVER used UR5e.

**Answer**: **UR5e**, loaded via
`robot_descriptions.loaders.mujoco.load_robot_description("ur5e_mj_description")`.
Reasons:
- 6-DOF standard serial arm; matches the `(arm_6, gripper_1, finger_N)`
  action vector `initial_plan.md` §3.3 already writes.
- Default in mink's own arm examples — minimal integration risk.
- `attachment_site` on the tool flange is the natural frame for the
  Stage 2 `FrameTask` target and is also exactly where a Stage 3 dexterous
  hand would be mounted. Arm and hand remain decoupled: Stage 2 solves for
  the 6 arm DOFs to put the wrist where the human wrist is, Stage 3
  retargets fingers independently against the same episodes, and the two
  are concatenated at action-assembly time.

**How to apply (Stage 2/3/4)**:
- Stage 2: IK target is `attachment_site`; home keyframe `home` (the MJCF's
  only keyframe) is a safe seed. Joint order is
  `[shoulder_pan, shoulder_lift, elbow, wrist_1, wrist_2, wrist_3]`; all
  revolute; joint limits `±2π` except elbow `±π`.
- Stage 3: treat the arm as solved; choose the dex hand without having to
  revisit the arm.
- Stage 4: the LeRobot action head predicts 6 arm DOFs + gripper + N finger
  DOFs. Dimensionality is fixed at 7+N.

The Stage 3 dex-hand choice (Inspire vs. Allegro vs. LEAP) is still an open
question; see "Open questions" above.

### R-002: Stage 2 — ARKit confidence threshold recalibration  *(answered 2026-04-07)*
**Original question** (surfaced 2026-04-07 from the §0.3 single-episode dump):
The `initial_plan.md` §2.1 plan filters at `min_confidence = 0.5`. On episode 0
no per-hand mean confidence reached even 0.7. Is the threshold wrong?

**Answer**: Yes, 0.5 is too aggressive — it throws out 42% of all samples,
much of which is real tracking. The distribution is **bimodal** with a clear
"untracked floor" mode at 0.000–0.003 (17.9% of samples) and a broad tracked
mode spanning 0.2 – 1.0.

Numbers (806,775 confidence samples — 25 joints × all frames × 277 episodes,
active hand only, basic_pick_place):

| stat | value |
|------|-------|
| min  | 0.000 |
| p05  | 0.003 |
| p10  | 0.003 |
| p25  | 0.257 |
| p50  | 0.614 |
| p75  | 0.816 |
| p90  | 0.895 |
| p99  | 0.996 |
| max  | 1.000 |
| mean | 0.529 |
| std  | 0.327 |

Single biggest unique value: **0.0032 with 15.58% of all samples** — this is
ARKit's "no signal" floor for joints it failed to track that frame. Anything
above ~0.05 is in the genuinely-tracked mode. The full discrete-floor +
broad-distribution shape is bimodal, valley between 0.05 and 0.20.

Threshold sweep — fraction of samples kept:
- `> 0.1`: **82.0%** ← recommended "tracked at all" threshold
- `> 0.2`: 78.8%
- `> 0.3`: 72.0%
- `> 0.5`: 58.0% ← original §2.1 plan; throws out a lot of real data
- `> 0.7`: 42.0%
- `> 0.8`: 27.9% ← too aggressive

**Recalibrated thresholds**:
- **`min_confidence = 0.1`** for "is this joint tracked at all?" — use this
  as the default reject filter in Stage 2 IK preprocessing. It removes the
  floor mode without dipping into real measurements.
- **`min_confidence = 0.5`** for "is this a *high quality* observation?" —
  use this for confidence-aware weighting (contribution pitch #1 in
  `initial_plan.md`), not for hard rejection.
- Compute confidence per-joint (not averaged across the whole hand). The
  wrist is generally tracked better than distal finger tips, so a hand-wide
  average would over-penalize "good wrist + flaky pinky tip" frames.

**How to apply (Stage 2)**: in `extract_wrist_trajectory` (and the analogous
finger extractor), gate on `confidences/<jointName> > 0.1`. When implementing
contribution #1 (confidence-aware filtering), use the per-joint score
directly as an IK task weight rather than thresholding twice.

## Open questions (resolve before the relevant stage)
- **Stage 4**: MuJoCo eval env for `basic_pick_place` — build from scratch, or reuse
  an existing one (mujoco_menagerie? lerobot envs)? Defer until Stage 4 actually
  starts; estimate time then.
- **Stage 4**: lerobot install path — try `uv pip install --no-deps lerobot`
  + hand-install remaining deps, or fork to bump `torch<2.11`? Decide when
  Stage 4 starts; D-001 documents the choice.

|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0     | done — 2026-04-07 | Test split downloaded + extracted; exploration + variance report; R-001/R-002 calibrated. (`part2` download is obsolete per D-005; concept reading is on the user, not Claude.) |
| 1     | done — 2026-04-08 | Full batch over all 277 `basic_pick_place` episodes: 271 `exact`, **6 `ransac_fallback` (stub)**, 0 failures. Reduction ratio median 2.50×, p95 8.28×, 61.7% of episodes > 2×, 24.5% > 4×. Inlier H-RMSE median 2.66 px, 92.4% < 10 px. Raw cam angle median 0.17°/frame (low-motion AVP wearer). See `doc.md` §8.5.5 for distributions. The 6 fallback episodes are documented under R-006; the vidstab path is still a stub and will be wired in only if Stage 4 metrics regress on them. |
| 2     | done — 2026-04-08 (first cut) | Full batch over all 277 episodes: **0 failures**, 62.7 s wall total (~0.23 s/ep). pos_err median distribution: mean 2.48 mm, p95 4.53 mm, **max 99.6 mm** (one bad ep). 96.8% of episodes have pos_err median < 5 mm. ori_err median 0.29° (median of medians). FIVER-collapse guard: **90.6%** of episodes clear ≥5/6 joints > 0.3 rad, 49.5% clear 6/6. No systemic FIVER collapse, but the 0.3-rad-on-all-6-joints threshold is tighter than necessary — per the Stage 4 §4.4 ablation we care about the reaching joints clearing it, which ~100% do. Stage 2 IK tail (8 episodes with p95 > 50 mm) does not overlap with the Stage 1 R-006 episodes — it's an IK-convergence issue, not a data issue. Investigation deferred; see `doc.md` §8.6.8. |
| 3     | done — 2026-04-08 (first cut + quality assessment) | `src/mimicdreamer_egodex/finger_retargeting.py` written; **Inspire** hand locked in via R-007 (dex-retargeting ships the config out of the box, URDFs vendored at `third_party/dex-urdf@7304c7f`). Full batch over all 277 episodes: **0 failures, 90.7 s total (~2.4 ms/frame mean)**, 96.8% of episodes clear 6/6 target proximals > 0.1 rad. Task-adaptive thumb opposition visible (stapler 0.68 rad vs iPhone 0.48 rad yaw). **Quality assessment (R-008)**: per-finger position error median 5–10 mm (Inspire fingerpad ~15 mm — fine for power grasps, marginal for precision); per-object grasp clustering on 25 objects shows separation ratio 0.95, silhouette −0.15 — captures **affordance class** but not within-class precision. Verdict: **enough for Stage 4 BC training**, not a finished dexterous teleop system. Stage 3 tail (9 episodes with <6/6) decomposes into 3 Stage-1-R-006 overlaps + 6 short (<80-frame) episodes. Zero overlap with the Stage 2 IK tail. See `doc.md` §8.7 (esp. §8.7.8). |

## Things we are explicitly NOT doing (yet)

- **H2R visual diffusion**: requires paired real-robot data we don't have. Skipped
  per `initial_plan.md` rationale.
- **Training on all 194 EgoDex tasks**: stick to `basic_pick_place` for the
  ablation, per §4.2. Scale experiments belong to "potential original
  contributions" §4.
